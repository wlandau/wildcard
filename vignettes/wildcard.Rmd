The wildcard package is a templating mechanism for data frames. Wildcards are placeholders for text, and you can evaluate them to generate new data frames from templates. The functionality is straightforward.

## `wildcard()`

```{r wildcard}
library(wildcard)
myths <- data.frame(myth = c("Bigfoot", "UFO", "Loch Ness Monster"), 
                    claim = c("various", "day", "day"), 
                    note = c("various", "pictures", "reported day"))
myths
wildcard(myths, wildcard = "day", values = c("today", "yesterday"))
wildcard(myths, wildcard = "day", values = c("today", "yesterday"), expand = FALSE)
locations <- data.frame(myth = c("Bigfoot", "UFO", "Loch Ness Monster"), origin = "where")
rules <- list(where = c("North America", "various", "Scotland"), UFO = c("spaceship", "saucer"))
wildcard(locations, rules = rules, expand = c(FALSE, TRUE))
numbers <- data.frame(x = 4, y = 3, z = 4444, w = 4.434)
wildcard(numbers, wildcard = 4, values = 7)
```

## `expandrows()`

```{r expandrows}
df <- data.frame(ID = c("24601", "Javert", "Fantine"), 
                 fate = c("fulfillment", "confusion", "misfortune"))
expandrows(df, n = 2, type = "each")
expandrows(df, n = 2, type = "times")
```

## `nofactors()`

```{r nofactors}
class(iris$Species)
str(iris)
out <- nofactors(iris)
class(out$Species)
str(out)
```
